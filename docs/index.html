        <p>The steam and smoke billowing from the hull of the airship now clouds Ezekiel’s vision. As it begins to clear with a wave from his hands, he gazes upon the vessel in its full glory as it returns from its test flight. A slender elven man leaps from the deck onto a vent on the starboard hull, before springing to land beside Ezekiel. Dorian Toriqui is a Wood Elf from the Silver Coast’s wildlands, his long black hair is tied up into the traditional triple loop of Silver Coast natives. As he regains his balance, Ezekiel places his hand on Dorian’s shoulder to steady him. <br/>
          “I take it you aren’t a fan?” says Ezekiel in his signature gravel-filled voice. <br/><br/>
          “I’m not one for heights lest I can see the floor below my feet Ezekiel my friend.” Dorian quips, having now regained his balance. <br/><br/>
          “Regardless of your personal matters, will it be sufficient as a mode of transportations between the cities?”<br/><br/>
          ”I am afraid so, the thing flies beautifly, less noise than my uncle, and he’s been below the trees for four decades now.”<br/><br/>
          He points to the side of the now anchored airship, “I’m thinking once we get them really started, racing might be worth an investment”<br/><br/>
          Ezekiel’s expression turns sour, “These ships are for the benefit of all who reside in the floating cities, it is the first time trade and transportation has been made practical, I will not let my beloved’s creation become belittled to that of entertainment, Dorian!”<br/><br/>
          The crowd around that was performing inspections and general observers, now begin murmuring amongst themselves, occasionally pointing at the pair.<br/><br/>
          “Alright I hear you, just a businessman thinking of business, did not mean harm by it”<br/><br/>
          Ezekiel’s expression returns to normal and he reaches for the green leather bound journal in his belt pouch. He readies an ink pen and shuffles over to the engineer who was aboard during the flight to copy down his notes. Dorian wonders about the dock, stepping with his long slim legs obnoxiously rapping his feet against the wooden boards below. Ezekiel, at the end of his rope, snaps his green journal closed, halting the still rambling engineer. The now angry Ezekiel gathers a small flame in his hand, and casts its direction at the now bent over Dorian. As the flame strikes his behind, the elf leaps with a yelp. <br/><br/>
          “Oi!!!!” Ezekiel smirks and gestures for the engineer to continue. As Dorian pats out the flame on his trousers, he turns to the wizard and scowls, before leaving the dock and heading towards the newly finished tavern. “Leave it to the dwarves to finish the tavern before the city hall,” thinks Dorian gratefully, his pace increasing. Just as the elf reaches the door to the newly established Sky High Bar, he is knocked forwards onto the ground by a shockwave. Scrambling to his feet Dorian gazes wide eyed as the now flying airship mast. As the fireball erupts, it engulfs the dock and climbs into the sky. Dorian brushes some dust off of his shoulder and waits patiently as the workers around him stand in a panicked awe. <br/><br/>
          “You sure you translated that book right Ezekiel?” Dorian murmurs aloud.<br/><br/><br/>
          “Positive,” Dorian turns his head slowly to the now ash covered Ezekiel. “Must have been faulty construction,”says the wizard as the last of the dimensional rip closes up behind him. Dorian enters the bar and grabs a bottle of distilled thunder cloud. He pops the cork and with a small crash the billowing grey smoke leaves the bottle. Ezekiel holds up two glasses and Dorian pours the royal blue liquid into one, before swigging the bottle. <br/> <br/>
          “Well,” says Dorian wiping his mouth, “I suggest you have someone check your measurements.” He pats Ezekiel on the shoulder and lumbers away down the main street of the soon to be founded, capital of the floating cities.  <br/><br/>

      <p>The blinding sleet covers the forest in a sheet of white. As his visibility reduces to no farther than his own nose, Camriel reaches for his pack. After feeling around for a torch and his tinderbox, he unsuccessfully attempts to light the torch.
        <br/>“Curse this forest,” sputters Camriel as he shoves the useless tools back into his bag, swinging it back to his shoulders once more. The human from the desert country of Leprait did not take kindly to this sudden bitter cold. His scruffy brown hair was matted down and covered in frost. He thanked the gods quietly that he had decided to buy a new fur coat before crossing the Frost Forest. 
        <br/>“Maybe the locals were onto something when they steered us towards the mountain path.” Aster shouted over the howling wind towards the rising Camriel. Aster was a short statured human dressed in a similar fur coat to Camriel. His red hair, under the heavy fur hood, just barely poked out as he sidled up to the leader with his staff aiding him through the thick snow. “Should we head back?”
        <br/>“Nonsense, if I am not cold, you lot have no excuse.” Hurin stomped next to Aster almost knocking him to the ground. The tall woman wore the same fur coat as the others, however, her immense stature made most of her arms and pants exposed to the cold without additional padding. She was unable to pull the hood up, so her bobbed white hair flowed into her face in this unrelenting wind. Unlike the other two, Hurin seemed unfazed by the cold and gave the other two a glare before once again picking up the round white object she had been tasked with carrying. Camriel sighed to himself and signaled for Aster to follow Hurin. He adjusted his belt and blade on his side before climbing after his two companions.
        <br/>After a few more minutes of forced march, the trio released a collective sigh of relief as the bitter breeze suddenly subsided. As it did, they all gazed upon the clearing they were now standing in the center of. Confused, Camriel wondered how they had gotten there, the wind would have been reduced by the dense trees on the exterior of the clearing. It should have. Just as he contemplated just how he and his friends had stumbled into this place, the hairs on his neck pricked up. Before he could say anything Hurin had dropped the white egg and drawn her greataxe. Aster, shocked at the sudden movement, moves back to back with the other two, as Camriel draws his ancient longsword, the runic symbols that run along the obsidian blade, glow with a dim red light. 
        <br/>“Care to share what the hostility is for?” Camriel projects into the clearing outskirts. The sound of footsteps draws the group's attention North of the clearing. Emerging from the forest are two humanoid figures. At first Camriel believes them to be elves, but their skin color is an ice blue color, not typical of any elves he’s seen before. The figure on the left is wearing what appears to be tribal clothing colored in white and blue, Camriel becomes confused as his eyes rise to the creature's face, where a metal plate seemingly covers the elf’s eyes. Aster’s vision drifts to the figure on the right. A slim elven woman with the same light blue skin as the other. Their hair was stark white, and their eyes seemingly pierced through Aster’s skull in anger. She carried an ornate handaxe with a chain connected to the end. As she gets closer to the group, her right arm guiding her blindfolded companion, the other using the connected chain to swing the handaxe in a large vertical circle. As the pair reaches a mere 15 feet from Camriel and the others, the female tosses the spinning handaxe in the direction of Aster, he stands motionless as the handaxe drives itself right next to him and then stopping still in the air, before flying back to the elf’s hand after pulling on the chain. Aster, unable to react to the sudden attack, falls on his behind in shock. 
        <br/>“Now, Niara, calm yourself,” says the Blindfolded figure putting her hands at her side. Hurin steps in between the fallen Aster and the two elves. As she does this, she notices the metal plate over the male elf’s eyes and a similar metal plate covering the female elf’s mouth, in a makeshift permanent muzzle. “Apologies, my sister does not take kindly to trespassers,” says the male elf looking Hurin in the eyes. The trio shivers, still on their guard, and the two elves seemingly unfazed by the splintering cold now step even closer. The male elf takes a half bow, “My name is Kelreath, this,” he gestures to the wild beast of an elf to his left, “is my sister, Niara. What brings you to this place?” 
        <br/>“Nothing in particular, just passing through,” lies Camriel. The male elf tilts his head slightly on it’s side and twitches. 
        <br/>“You should know boy,” says Kelreath sharpening his tone, “it is unwise to lie to your elders.” Without warning, as Kelreath reaches his hands to the sky as a bitter wind swirls around the trio once more. Just as Camriel loses vision once more, he catches a glimpse of Niara, twisting her axe in her hand. As the white wash blinds Camriel he just barely notices the metal muzzle almost forcibly twisting into a barely crooked smile.
